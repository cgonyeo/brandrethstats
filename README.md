# This implementation is bad, and I do not-ok things in it. I rewrote this to be better in every way, its repo lives [here](https://github.com/dgonyeo/brandreth2.0)

Brandreth Stats
===============

A flask app that displays entries and generates graphs about a guest book.

Run dbpopulator.py to update the spreadsheet (if you're not me, you don't have access to it). Then run flaskapp.py to run the site. It generates pages from the html files and the downloaded .csv file.
